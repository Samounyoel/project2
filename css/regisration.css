#panda {

  font-size: 0.85rem; /* Adjust to match general text feel */

/* Ensure that #registrationForm .input-box label inherits from auth-styles.css or is specifically styled */

/* The .input-box.button input styling is now largely handled by .button input[type="submit"] in auth-styles.css. */
/* Specific overrides can go here if absolutely necessary, but it's better to rely on the shared style. */
